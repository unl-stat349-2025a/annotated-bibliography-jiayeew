# First Review Article: ImageNet Classification with Deep Convolutional Neural Networks
- @krizhevskyImageNetClassificationDeep2012
1. Introduction: 
- Introduces object recognition, the role of machine learning, the need for larger datasets and the need for better GPUs
- It smoothly introduces the problem, the results and the need for better data and GPUs
- They could briefly introduce CNNs to provide some context, allowing the readers that are unfamiliar with the concept of CNN to grasp the basics early on

2. Dataset: 
- Explains why small datasets are inadequate for complex object recognition and why larger datasets are necessary. Also explains the importance of scaling up
- I think it logically follows the introduction because a model cannot exist without data, which makes it natural to discuss datasets first before the model.
- Could elaborate more on the limitation of small datasets. 

3. Architecture
- Introduces CNN architecture and its ability to capture local dependencies.
- I think it connects well with the previous section by introducing CNN as the solution to the dataset limitations
- Can include a brief comparison of CNNs to other traditional machine learning models used

4. Reduce Overfitting
- Discusses techniques used to reduce overfitting.
- I think it connects well with the previous section by diving deeper into the model’s structure and improvements.
- Could explain what PCA is 

5. Details of Learning
- Covers the hyperparameters used in training.
- Follows logically by further explaining the architecture’s details.
- Could explain stochastic gradient descent to understand better

6. Results
- Presents the results and provides test images.
- Follows a natural progression, because I think it is the appropriate point to discuss performance.
- Could explain Euclidean distance to clarify why did it use Euclidean when evaluating the model

7. Discussion
- Acknowledges the results and suggests possible improvements for better performance
- I think it provides a natural conclusion by discussing future suggestion
- Mentions that unsupervised pre-training could help but does not provide any evidence or hypotheses on how it might improve performance

# Second Review Article: A survey of deep learning techniques for autonomous driving 
- @grigorescuSurveyDeepLearning2020

1. Introduction 
- The introduction discusses early research in autonomous cars and how deep learning and AI have advanced computer vision, robotics, and NLP
- It sets the stage by moving from the broader impact of AI to its specific role in autonomous vehicles (AVs)
- It would be better to briefly mention the significance of deep learning before going deeper into AVs

2. Deep Learning-Based Decision-Making Architectures Used in Self-Driving Cars
- Introduces self-driving decision-making, two major AI architectures for decision-making, and components of the modular pipeline
- The transition is smooth, but adding a short sentence at the end of the introduction to link AI challenges with decision-making architecture could improve flow
- The section describes the two approaches, could have compare their strengths and weaknesses

3. Overview of Deep Learning Technologies
- The section covers methods like deep CNNs, RNNs, and deep reinforcement learning
_ I think the transition into the core section on different deep learning methods is smooth as it clearly oultine the focus on CNNs, RNNs, and DRL.
- Doesnt mention of supervised learning, because autonomous system normally uses supervised learning

4. Deep Learning for Driving Scene Perception and Localization
- Introduces sensing hardware, driving scene understanding, and areas that are still underdeveloped
- The transition between Section 4.1 and Section 4.2 (Driving Scene Understanding) feels a bit abrupt. A brief linking sentence maybe would improve in understanding

5. Deep Learning for Path Planning and Behavior Arbitration
- Explains the role of path planning in autonomous driving and compares imitation learning and deep reinforcement learning
- It mentions that IL struggles with rare scenarios and DRL has biases when moving from simulation to real-world settings, but it doesn’t provide solutions for these challenges

6. Motion Controllers for AI-Based Self-Driving Cars
- Discusses learning controllers and end-to-end learning
- It mentions PilotNet’s similarity to human perception but doesn’t provide a detailed comparison of performance metrics between AI and human drivers

7. Safety of Deep Learning in Autonomous Driving
- It defines safety in machine learning and discusses challenges in DL-based safety assessment, real-world failures, and safety measures
- It mentions ISO 26262, it doesn’t explore other regulations for AI safety in autonomous driving

8. Data Sources for Training Autonomous Driving Systems
- Talks about the importance of real-world data in training and testing autonomous systems
- Challenges related to data privacy, ethical considerations in public data collection, and dataset representation are not discussed

9. Computational Hardware and Deployment
- It covers key hardware solutions for deep learning in autonomous vehicles
- There is no direct comparison of computational capabilities, power consumption, or cost-effectiveness of the hardware solutions

10. Discussion and Conclusions
- Discusses how deep learning helps overcome challenges in autonomous vehicles.
- Could explain more on how to improve the explainability of deep learning models, particularly in critical decision-making scenarios.
